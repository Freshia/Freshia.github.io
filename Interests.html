            <h2 class="mb-3">Poetry</h2>
            <p>Some of my favourite poems.
            </p>
            
            <h4 class="mb-3">The Red Wheelbarrow - William Carlos WIlliams</h4>
            <p>so much depends upon</p>
            
            <p>a red wheelbarrow</p>
            <p>glazed with rainwater</p>
            <p>beside the white chickens</p>
            
            <h4 class="mb-3">All the World's a stage - William Shakespeare</h4>
            <p>  All the world’s a stage,
And all the men and women merely players;
They have their exits and their entrances;
And one man in his time plays many parts,
His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
Mewling and puking in the nurse’s arms;
And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel
And shining morning face, creeping like snail
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
Made to his mistress’ eyebrow. Then a soldier,
Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,
Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,
Seeking the bubble reputation
Even in the cannon’s mouth. And then the justice,
In fair round belly with good capon lin’d,
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
Full of wise saws and modern instances;
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
Into the lean and slipper’d pantaloon,
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;
His youthful hose, well sav’d, a world too wide
For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
That ends this strange eventful history,
Is second childishness and mere oblivion;
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.</p>

<h4 class="mb-3">The road not taken - Robert Frost</h4>
<p>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;</p>
<p>Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,</p>
<p>And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.</p>
<p>I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.</p>

<h4 class="mb-3">You Foolish Men - Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz</h4>
<p>You foolish men who lay
the guilt on women,
not seeing you're the cause
of the very thing you blame;</p>
<p>if you invite their disdain
with measureless desire
why wish they well behave
if you incite to ill.</p>
<p>You fight their stubbornness,
then, weightily,
you say it was their lightness
when it was your guile.</p>
<p>In all your crazy shows
you act just like a child
who plays the bogeyman
of which he's then afraid.</p>
<p>With foolish arrogance
you hope to find a Thais
in her you court, but a Lucretia
when you've possessed her.</p>
<p>What kind of mind is odder
than his who mists
a mirror and then complains
that it's not clear.</p>
<p>Their favour and disdain
you hold in equal state,
if they mistreat, you complain,
you mock if they treat you well.</p>
<p>No woman wins esteem of you:
the most modest is ungrateful
if she refuses to admit you;
yet if she does, she's loose.</p>
<p>You always are so foolish
your censure is unfair;
one you blame for cruelty
the other for being easy.</p>
<p>What must be her temper
who offends when she's
ungrateful and wearies
when compliant?</p>
<p>But with the anger and the grief
that your pleasure tells
good luck to her who doesn't love you
and you go on and complain.</p>
<p>Your lover's moans give wings
to women's liberty:
and having made them bad,
you want to find them good.</p>
<p>Who has embraced
the greater blame in passion?
She who, solicited, falls,
or he who, fallen, pleads?</p>
<p>Who is more to blame,
though either should do wrong?
She who sins for pay
or he who pays to sin?</p>
<p>Why be outraged at the guilt
that is of your own doing?
Have them as you make them
or make them what you will.</p>
<p>Leave off your wooing
and then, with greater cause,
you can blame the passion
of her who comes to court?</p>
<p>Patent is your arrogance
that fights with many weapons
since in promise and insistence
you join world, flesh and devil.</p>
